# GAN-AnimeFaces
 
Purpose - Purely educational. I've created CNN for flower and MNIST classification.
The next logical step in this ML journey in my mind would be deconvolutional/convolutional networks ... otherwise known as Generative Aderverial Networks (GANs)

Code provided for educational purposes.

December update:
- Explored learning rate (5e-1, 1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4 (base), 1e-5, and 1e-6)
- Explored processing options in Tensorflow to aid in speeding up data processing (prefetch, shuffle, batch_size)
- Read about alternative computations to the original GAN
-- WGAN being the primary popular option
-- Yet to implement because my computer is unhappy with the previous processing jobs
